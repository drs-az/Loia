## 🌊 What is Loia?

Loia is a prompt-powered assistant designed to run on large language models like OpenAI's GPT-4. It helps users:

- 🎼 **Build custom playlists** based on mood, vibe, or activity  
- 🎧 **Discover pre-existing playlists** optimized for 12-second crossfade + Automix  
- 🧠 **Understand transitions**, BPM compatibility, harmonic key, and emotional flow  
- 🎯 **Export playlist-ready CSVs** for easy import via tools like [Soundiiz](https://soundiiz.com)

Loia was trained to think like:
- A conservatory-trained composer  
- A live DJ with flawless transitions  
- A Rick Rubin-esque musical philosopher  
- A vibe-obsessed design thinker

## 🧠 How It Works

Loia follows a curated system prompt designed to:

1. Ask the user for their vibe, activity, crossfade settings, and Automix status.
2. Offer two paths:
   - Search for **existing Spotify playlists**
   - Build a **custom playlist from scratch**
3. For custom playlists:
   - Curate tracklists using BPM, key, and narrative arc
   - Group into \"Movements\" if applicable
   - Generate a downloadable CSV file
   - Provide Soundiiz import instructions
4. Deliver a professional-grade, emotionally resonant playlist—ready to drop into Spotify

## ✨ Why It Matters

Crossfade isn’t just a feature.  
It’s a **brushstroke**.

Most playlist tools shuffle songs. Loia designs **experiences**.  
It doesn’t just recommend—it *curates, blends, and scores* your moment.

If music is emotional architecture, Loia is your master builder.
